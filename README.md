wetdirt is intended to be a simple and relatively monolithic piece of activitypub software

Probably
- Separate frontend

Maybe but won't worry about now
- Allow scaling by splitting tasks up accross multiple devices
    - I do have to say I'm suspicious of instances large enough to need such a thing
    - Could provide a jumping off point for smoother migration between machines or versions. Maybe allow zero downtime??

Stage zero:
garbage webpage

Stage one:
Basic web interface
